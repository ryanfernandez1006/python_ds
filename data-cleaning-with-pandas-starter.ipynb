    "The `.astype()` function is very useful for converting between compatible datatypes, but it has limitations. What happens when you try to convert the string 'a' or 'b' to a `float` or `int`? Is this even possible? If you try  `.astype('float')` on a column that contains strings, the function will raise an exception. Specifically if you tried this on the 'NOX' column you would get the following error: `ValueError: could not convert string to float: a`. One way to get around this is to replace the value of those cells with the mean value of the rest of the column. Another would be to just drop the rows with the wrongly formatted data. We'll explore both approaches.\n",

    "In the below example we'll be using Regular Expressions or regex to find the alphabetic characters. There are a ton of other interesting and powerful things you can do with regex but we'll start basic. The code below searches the 'NOX' column for any alphabetic characters from A-Z for uppercase and a-z for lowercase. It returns boolean array the same length as the 'NOX' column where 'True' means there was an a letter (A-Z or a-z) in that cell and 'False' means there wasn't. When we pass this array in to the original dataframe, we're filtering, or masking, the dataframe to only show the values in a `True` cell. The end result is a dataframe that shows which rows had letters in the 'NOX' column. "
