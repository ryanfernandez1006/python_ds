    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to use matplotlib, a plotting library for Python, to create visualizations in the Jupyter notebook. Visualizing data is especially important during exploratory data analysis, as it can help you uncover trends and relationships between variables. Throughout this lesson, you'll be using the pyplot collection of functions within the matplotlib library. The matplotlib.pyplot functions track each change you make to a figure, like adding labels or changing colors, until you use`.show()` to reveal the final product.\n",

For instance, the first plot in a grid of 2 rows and three columns would be added like this: `fig.add_subplot(2,3,1)`.
