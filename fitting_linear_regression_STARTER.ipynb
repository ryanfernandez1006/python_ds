    "A linear regression is a machine learning technique that models the relationship between explanatory variables (also called predictor variables, independent variables, or x-variables) and a continuous dependent variable (also called the target or y-variable). In the Boston housing dataset, the target variable is MEDV (median home value). It's considered continuous because there are unlimited possibilities (ranging from zero to infinity) for what value this variable could take. This is in contrast to discrete variables, which you can think of as categories. For discrete variables, values can only fall into one out of a finite number of options. You'll use linear regression to find the relationship between the predictor variables (nitric oxide concentrations, proximity to the Charles River, etc), and the median home value for towns in Boston."

    "There are two common scenarios in which linear regression may be useful. The first is making predictions or forecasting. In these situations, you fit a model to learn the relationship between some predictor variables and a target variable. If you want to know the value of the target variable in some new case, the model can make a prediction for you. One example might be forecasting the profits of a business in the next quarter based on data you've collected this quarter. For the Boston housing data, you'll be able to predict the median home value for new towns (as long as you collect data on nitric oxide levels, number of rooms per home, etc). Notice that you can either predict future values, or simply values for cases you haven't seen before.\n",

    "When it comes to deciding between evaluating a model using MAE, or another metric, root mean squared error (RMSE), you must consider the effect of outliers. An outlier is a value very far from the mean and median of the dataset. Given that our model was trained on median home values ranging from about \\$3,000 to \\$55,000, we can be confident that it would make accurate predictions within this range. However, what if we asked the model to predict the value for a town whose median home value was \\$100,000. This is far outside the range the model trained on, so it's likely going to guess way wrong.\n",
    "\n",

Now that you know how to do this for linear regressions using Scikit-Learn, you can easily transfer these same steps to a logistic regression or some other type of model. Just remember the basic steps: **fit**, **predict**, and **evaluate**."
